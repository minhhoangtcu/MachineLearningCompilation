# Machine Learning Compilation
Contains all my machine learning work

## Project Description
**Titanic** - The first project in my data mining class using Weka for analyzing and Jupyter Notebook for graphing. This project is able to predict who would survive before boarding the ship. For education purpose, we train various models with OneR, ZeroR, J48, NaiveBayes, and Linear Regression.

**NameTagging** - A short project to solve a name tagging problem from limited data. Check out more on my [medium post](https://medium.com/@minhhoang_50731/solving-a-weird-name-tagging-rule-1dfe66b8b7c1#.v6r6cr8yj)
